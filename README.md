Some Arduino Projects Developed or Prepared By Mine

**1. ELECTRONIC TOLL SYSTEM ðŸš¦**

This project simulates an **Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)** system using IR sensors, Arduino, and a servo motor. Vehicles are detected via IR signals, displaying their toll rate on an LCD. A **5-second countdown** allows users to make payment; successful payment opens the gate, while failure resets the system. LEDs indicate payment status, and the servo motor automates gate control. This project can be modified to include an **RFID system** and **weight-based tolling** for more advanced functionality.
